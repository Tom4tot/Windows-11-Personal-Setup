# Windows 11 Personal Setup

### Installation
- Download the official iso file from Microsoft: https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11
- Create bootable USB with [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/), leave everything as default (GPT, UEFI, NTFS), and customize the *Windows User Experience*: tick everything
  - Benefits: faster than Microsoft's tool, makes the use of a local account easier, skips privacy questions (all will be off)
- Naviagate to /sources in and add the ei.cfg attached to this repo.
  - Benefits: it will bypass your current Windows key and allow you to choose Windows Pro instead of Windows Home.
- Reboot and install Windows. Make sure to delete all your partitions (except the data one, if you have one) and to choose the professional edition.
